        So with the start of the new year, it's the perfect time to reflect on
        the past and look forward to the future. Looking forward to the future
        gives me an incredible amount of anxiety, so instead I will just be
        reflecting on the past in this article. Last year was the year that I
        started something that has consumed my life, personality, soul, and skin
        (literally): bouldering.

      <h2 class="mb-2">Why write about bouldering?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, why should you care about my experience with bouldering?
        Well, technically you shouldn't, but I've been having a really bad
        writer's block recently and I wanted to write about something that would
        come easy to me. Since I can't keep my mouth shut anyway about this
        subject, I thought I might as well write about it. Besides that, I also
        want to use this as a way of introducing bouldering to the ones that
        haven't got any experience with it, and for the ones that do, provide
        some of the things I've learned over the past year.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="mb-2">What exactly is bouldering?</h2>
      <p>
        With all of that out of the way, let's first discuss what bouldering is.
        At first I was planning on writing a very long paragraph here describing
        the correct definition of bouldering, but what's the fun in that?
        Instead you will get my personal short definition. Bouldering is the art
        of climbing (mostly) colored plastic rocks on walls that are usually not
        bigger than 5 meters. I say mostly, since outdoor climbing is also a
        thing, but I haven't yet had the opportunity to touch real rock, so I'll
        stick to indoor climbing in this article. Bouldering involves completing
        routes, also known as 'problems', which have a defined start and end
        point. The difficulty of these routes are defined by grades.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="mb-2">How it all began</h2>
      <p>
        My first experience with bouldering was through a good friend of mine.
        He took me and a friend of ours to a gym in Tilburg, where we all
        studied at the time. Funnily enough the friend that introduced us to
        bouldering has stopped since, and me and my other friend are still going
        strong to this day. This experience was years ago though, since at the
        time I was still preoccupied with other sports like Kendo, but I still
        loved my very first session. Fast forward like a year and my time with
        Kendo was coming to a close, and I was searching for something else to
        fill the spot. I went bouldering again in the spring of 2024 in a new
        gym that had recently opened in Tilburg, and I've been obsessed ever
        since.

      <br />
      <h2 class="mb-2">Why I love bouldering</h2>
      <p>
        What makes bouldering such a fun sport? I think there are hundreds of
        reasons one could say, but today I will keep it limited to my personal 5
        biggest reasons I love this sport so much.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="pl-5 mb-2">1. It's like solving a puzzle with your body</h3>
      <p>
        If you've ever seen a bouldering competition or been to a bouldering gym
        yourself, you've likely seen the absurd ways people use their bodies in
        climbing. Some do a full-on split high in the air, some decompress
        themselves to mere atoms, and others take shapes that would impress even
        the most skilled yogis. Don't worry, this isn't something you'll likely
        be doing in the beginning of your climbing journey, but it's a great way
        to illustrate the puzzle solving that comes with bouldering. Every route
        is different, and you can be as creative as you'd like in completing it.
        This comparison gets made a lot, but I tend to agree with it: bouldering
        is the most video game-like sport there is.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="pl-5 mb-2">2. Exercising while playing</h3>
      <p>
        All this puzzling and problem solving isn't just great for your brain,
        but you tend to use your entire body while doing it. It mostly focuses
        the upper body, particularly the back and forearm muscles, but you still
        use your legs and the rest of your body a lot. When I go bouldering, the
        time flies by just as quickly as if I'm doing any other hobby, but that
        still gives me roughly a 2 hour workout whilst feeling that I'm just
        playing a game.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="pl-5 mb-2">3. Sense of progression</h3>
      <p>
        Especially in the beginning, the sense of progression and accomplishment
        is one of the most rewarding things I've personally felt while
        practicing a sport. Bouldering is so rich in its techniques and its
        variety of routes, that especially in the beginning, you feel like
        you're improving with each session. It's inevitable that this rate of
        progression will slow down eventually, but there is always something to
        work toward, a new route you want to complete, a new technique you want
        to master. There is always a reason to keep moving forward and become
        better than you were yesterday.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="pl-5 mb-2">4. Diversity of routes</h3>
      <p>
        I've touched on this subject shortly in some of the previous sections,
        but this deserves a highlight of its own. There is such an amazing range
        of varied routes that you can do, that there is something for everyone.
        There are, in my brain at least, 2 main differences in routes. The first
        are overhanging routes, where the wall is tilted outward. Overhangs are
        mostly focused on upper body and grip strength, since gravity pulls you
        away from the holds. These are my personal favorite kinds of routes, and
        they could be yours too if you want to feel like you're a spider
        crawling out of your nest.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The second one are slab routes, where the wall is tilted inwards. Slabs
        are more focused on balance and precise footwork, since gravity pushes
        you towards the wall. If the route setters used the same kinds of holds
        they do on overhangs here, the routes would be way too easy (due to the
        aforementioned gravity situation), so it's also famous for its miniscule
        holds that the naked eye cannot see. Here you can feel like a mountain
        goat hopping to the top, if you don't slip, which I do more than I would
        like to admit.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The main takeaway here is that there is something every body type is
        naturally good at, and everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. This
        to me makes it not only inclusive, but also an expression of self. If
        you'd like to argue that there exists no such thing as a self, then I'd
        probably agree with you, but the more philosophical stuff will have to
        wait for a future article.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="pl-5 mb-2">5. Community</h3>
      <p>
        I've been a part of some amazing communities over the years, having done
        a diverse range of sports and hobbies, but in my personal experience
        nothing compares to the warm hearted feeling I get every time I enter a
        boulder gym. There are people of all ages, children to adolescents to
        adults to elderly, trying the same problems and helping each other to
        accomplish what they themselves didn't think they could do. This sense
        of connection, everyone doing the same stuff in different ways with
        different backgrounds, is such a beautiful thing to witness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3 class="mb-2">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        I hope this article has properly conveyed my love for bouldering, and I
        hope even more that this convinced even one of my readers to try it out
        sometime. I've not yet hit my full one year of bouldering, but this
        sport has already grown to be such a big part of my life and it has
        meant more to me than I could possibly convey with words. For the ones
        that are wondering, the highest grade I've climbed to date is a 6c+, but
        I usually climb around the 6b+ grade mark. Thank you all for reading
        this article if you've made it this far, and I aim to write a lot more
        this year than I did the last, so stay tuned for more!
